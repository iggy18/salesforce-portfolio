# 🌩️ Salesforce Developer Portfolio

Hello there! Welcome to my Salesforce Developer Portfolio. Dive deep and explore my skills not just as a Salesforce Developer, but also as an Experience Cloud Developer. From classes to triggers, to Lightning Web Components (LWC), you'll find them all showcased here.

- [click here to visit my salesforce experience site/portfolio] (sethmcfeeters-dev-ed.develop.my.site.com)


## 🚀 Features

- **Experience Site**: Take a walk through the interactive experience site that I've designed and developed. I built it to my skills in Experience Cloud development.

- **Classes, Triggers & LWC**: Venture into the `force > main > default` directory and you'll find my meticulously crafted Salesforce classes, triggers, and LWCs. Every piece of code tells a story of a problem solved and a challenge overcome. 

- **identify code I've written**: When an experience cloud is deployed it comes with quite a few controllers and test classes. Because of this I will be adding SETH_{class name} to the classes that I have created so you can easily identify my work.

## 🔍 How to Explore

1. Begin with the Experience Site to get a feel of my user interface and user experience skills.
2. Head over to the `force > main > default` directory. Here's what you'll find:
   - 📁 **Classes**: My apex classes that bring the business logic to life.
   - 📁 **Triggers**: Automated actions for streamlined processes.
   - 📁 **LWC**: Dive into modern Salesforce UI development with my Lightning Web Components.
